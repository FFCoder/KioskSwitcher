# Kiosk Switcher
This is an Application which serves the purpose of allowing users to choose between Veritime and Papercut.

In our organization we were using an older application which worked but had a static timeout. This posed an issue
because people would be mid-way in an application and it would just exit.

This application works off of system activity time so as long as the user is utilizing the application, it will not close.
